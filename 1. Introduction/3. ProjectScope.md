# Scope of the Project
The scope of the EBookSy project encompasses the development of a comprehensive digital reading ecosystem, centered around the Bookie app. The primary goal is to offer users a rich and diverse digital library, providing access to a wide range of books and content across various genres. The project will also integrate a desktop scraper application, three core APIs (Auth API, BooksAPI, and Scraper Authentication API), and advanced features such as AI content generation, personalized recommendations, and user-generated content.

This ecosystem aims to create an immersive and engaging platform where users can not only discover and read books but also actively participate in the literary community. Features like collaborative reading groups, real-time notifications, and accessible tools ensure that the EBookSy experience is inclusive and interactive. The project also focuses on security and integrity by implementing PDF integrity checks using MD5 and SHA-1 cryptographic hash functions.

To achieve these objectives, the project will encompass the development of user-friendly interfaces, backend infrastructure, data storage, and robust algorithms. Ongoing monitoring and updates will be crucial to maintaining the platform's security, performance, and relevance in the ever-evolving landscape of digital reading. The project's success will be measured by its ability to provide a dynamic and secure digital reading environment that meets the diverse needs of its user community.
